# Exercise 6 - Show all Store Names
## Now it is your turn to take the steering wheel. Implement a new page that will return all the shop names.

* You need to create your own HTML page (all_stores.html) 
** Display all store names in a list, each name should be a link that will take you to the selected store menu.
* Add a method in your controller to resolve that page. (Use the mapping /coffee)
* Add the attributes to the page.
* Add a new method (getAllCoffeeStores) in your service layer that returns a List of all the stores.  
(Tip: Use the coffeeStoreRepository.findAll() method)
